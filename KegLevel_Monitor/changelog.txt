============================

SCHEDULED FOR UPDATE/FIX:

- update git install to accommodate onefile plus a few support files
- update git update to:
    - backup current ~/Desktop/KegLevel_Monitor/ directory into a backup_[datestamp] directory
    - (backup directory gives user a "snapshot in time" in case they want/need to downgrade)
    - (backup directory also serves to protect user from inadvertent deletes or edits of .json files or .py files)
    - provide user interaction: "The updater will copy all files from the project folder into a date stamped backup folder, then install updated application files. All system settings files will remain intact. Proceed with the update? Y to proceed, N to exit the updater without changes." 
    
- create installation video and pdf
    - "Quick Start" for experienced pi users and those who own a soldering iron and know how to use it
    - "Full Installation Guide" for users who are not familiar with the pi and who will not be soldering
   
============================

UPDATES / UPGRADES UNDER CONSIDERATION:

[medium priority]
- add support for YF S201 flow sensors
- add support for YF S401 flow sensors
- add support for SF800 flow sensors
- will probably need a switch in the System Settings popup to support different flow sensors

[low priority]
- add support for 2 scales via HX711 >> pico w >> bluetooth >> keglevel pi
    - directly wired to pi does not work due to cabling issues. cables from HX711 to pi must be 300 mm or shorter, which is impractical.

============================

Oct 25 2025
- Built minimizing script to simplify and improve run-time efficiency of development files

- Removed Pause/Resume Monitoring button and function
- Removed "Status" display area
- Changed Temp: -- to only show the measured temp and units, or -- and nothing else
- For the Keg selection "Unassigned" , changed to "Offline"
- Changed the default keg for taps to "Offline"
- Removed any red or yellow fill for the keg level bars; the red and yellow don't have meaning since switching to the flow sensors
- Reordered the Configuration section of the Settings menu:
  - Keg Settings
  - Beverage Library
  - Notification Settings
  - Flow Sensor Calibration
  - System Settings
- changed default number of taps to 5
- changed default keg names to Keg 01, Keg 02, Keg 03, Keg 04, Keg 05. No other text in the Keg Title area.

- updated the weight and volume units on the Edit Keg screen to reflect the currently selected Units (kg or lb, Liters or Gallons)
- on the System Settings popup, changed the order and labels of the Volume Display Units to: 
  - Metric (liters/kilograms)
  - US Imperial (gallons/pounds)
- changed the default Volume Display Units to Metric
- in the Taps area, changed the calculated remaining "pours" from 500 ml to 400 ml, see below for label change
- in the Taps area, changed the label 400 ml: (or Pints:) to 400 ml servings: (or Pint servings:) (based on selected units)
- in the Taps area, changed the label Liters: (or Gallons:) to Liters remaining: (or Gal remaining:) (based on selected units)
- on the System Settings popup, added section titled, "Pour Volume" and in that section put two user entry fields, one labeled ml and the other labeled oz. instead of the fixed pour size currently 500 ml or pint, use these new entries to calculate servings. update the Taps area display to reflect the serving size. default to 400 ml and 16 oz
- Deployed Flow Sensor Calibration popup
- Created a "Manually Enter Calibration Factor - Advanced Users Only" popup
    - allows user to view current raw calibration factor and enter a new one
    - provide a user-editable notes area, saved on close of popup
- Deployed a 30-day trial feature
